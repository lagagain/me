      Hi, I'm LAG-AGAIN(lagagain/LAG). I am a Master of MIS of National Sun Yat-sen University and a Bachelor of MIS at National Chiayi University.
      I interest in Information Technology. I like reading, drawing, browse YouTube, and writing an article. I agree Paul Graham say "A programmer as same as a designer" in "Hacker and Painter" . I think the programming language - LISP is very awesome.
      I have skills at Web Programming, JAVA, C/C++, Python and Lisp and more. I'm still learning Information Technology, and also I'm learning painting and language.
